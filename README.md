## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes text cleaning and feature engineering.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical features.
- **Classification Model**: Logistic Regression with high accuracy.
- **Interactive Streamlit App**: Test news articles in real-time.
